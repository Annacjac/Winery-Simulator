# Winery-Simulator
A simulation game made in Unreal Engine 5 that provides a relaxing experience of running a winery.

Play as a vintner as you grow your wine empire! Learn the basics of how wine is made, from growing and harvesting different grape varieties, to crushing and aging the juice, to bottling and packaging your orders. Use your revenue to upgrade your vineyard and wine cellar and unlock more grape varieties and wine recipes. With your new-found knowledge, take on  custom orders and create wines that match your clients' tastes, budget, and time constraints. Play precision-based mini-games for certain steps of the process to increase the wine's quality or speed up the aging process. 

This game is still in early stages of development. Feel free to download the progress to see the game so far and look at the code. Warning that it is not all cohesive yet. The purpose of this repository is to provide a demonstration of my Unreal Engine 5 knowledge for potential employers, and I will regularly release updates.
